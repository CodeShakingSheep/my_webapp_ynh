### Login using SFTP

Once installed, go to the chosen URL to know the username, domain and port you will have to use for the SFTP access. 

- Username: __ID__
- Password: password chosen during installation
- Port: __SSH_PORT__

To connect, you'll need an SFTP app such as [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) for Windows, Mac or Linux. You can also use your default file manager on [Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/connect-mac-shared-computers-servers-mchlp1140/mac) or Linux.

### Adding or editing files

Once logged in SFTP, under the Web directory, you will see a `www` folder which contains the public files served by this app. You can put all the files of your custom Web application inside.

### Forgot your SFTP password?

If you forgot your SFTP password, you can change it in YunoHost's webadmin interface in `Apps > My webapp > My Webapp configuration`.
